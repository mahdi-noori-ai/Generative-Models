Overview
This project aims to create a Capsule Network to classify images from the CIFAR-10 dataset. Capsule Networks are an advanced type of neural network designed to handle spatial hierarchies in image data more effectively than traditional convolutional neural networks (CNNs).

Dataset
The dataset used for this project is the CIFAR-10 dataset, which consists of 60,000 32x32 color images in 10 different classes, with 6,000 images per class.

Dataset Features
The dataset contains 50,000 training images and 10,000 test images.
Each image is a 32x32 pixel color image.
The images are labeled with the corresponding class:
Airplane, Automobile, Bird, Cat, Deer, Dog, Frog, Horse, Ship, Truck
Preprocessing
To prepare the dataset for training, the following preprocessing steps are applied:

Normalization: The pixel values of the images are normalized to the range [0, 1] to improve model performance.
Batching and Shuffling: The dataset is batched and shuffled to ensure a stable and efficient training process.
Example of Preprocessing Code
python
Copy code
import tensorflow as tf
import tensorflow_datasets as tfds

# Load and normalize the CIFAR-10 dataset
(train_data, test_data), info = tfds.load('cifar10', split=['train', 'test'], as_supervised=True, with_info=True)

def normalize_img(image, label):
    return tf.cast(image, tf.float32) / 255.0, label

train_data = train_data.map(normalize_img).batch(128).shuffle(10000)
test_data = test_data.map(normalize_img).batch(128)
Model Implementation
Capsule Network Model
The Capsule Network consists of two main types of layers: Primary Capsules and Digit Capsules. The Primary Capsules encode the spatial information, while the Digit Capsules handle the classification.

Example of Capsule Network Model Code
python
Copy code
from tensorflow.keras import layers

class PrimaryCapsule(layers.Layer):
    def __init__(self, num_capsules, dim_capsules, **kwargs):
        super(PrimaryCapsule, self).__init__(**kwargs)
        self.num_capsules = num_capsules
        self.dim_capsules = dim_capsules
        self.conv = layers.Conv2D(filters=self.num_capsules * self.dim_capsules,
                                  kernel_size=9,
                                  strides=2,
                                  padding='valid')

    def call(self, inputs):
        x = self.conv(inputs)
        x = tf.reshape(x, (-1, x.shape[1] * x.shape[2] * self.num_capsules, self.dim_capsules))
        return self.squash(x)

    def squash(self, vectors):
        s_squared_norm = tf.reduce_sum(tf.square(vectors), axis=-1, keepdims=True)
        scale = s_squared_norm / (1 + s_squared_norm)
        return scale * vectors / tf.sqrt(s_squared_norm + tf.keras.backend.epsilon())

class DigitCapsule(layers.Layer):
    def __init__(self, num_capsules, dim_capsules, num_routing=3, **kwargs):
        super(DigitCapsule, self).__init__(**kwargs)
        self.num_capsules = num_capsules
        self.dim_capsules = dim_capsules
        self.num_routing = num_routing

    def build(self, input_shape):
        self.W = self.add_weight(shape=[self.num_capsules, input_shape[1], self.dim_capsules, input_shape[2]],
                                 initializer='glorot_uniform',
                                 trainable=True)

    def call(self, inputs):
        inputs_expand = tf.expand_dims(inputs, 1)
        inputs_tiled = tf.tile(inputs_expand, [1, self.num_capsules, 1, 1])
        inputs_tiled = tf.expand_dims(inputs_tiled, -1)  # Add an extra dimension for correct matmul
        inputs_hat = tf.squeeze(tf.matmul(self.W, inputs_tiled), axis=-1)

        b = tf.zeros(shape=[tf.shape(inputs_hat)[0], self.num_capsules, inputs_hat.shape[2], 1])

        for i in range(self.num_routing):
            c = tf.nn.softmax(b, axis=1)
            s = tf.reduce_sum(c * inputs_hat, axis=2)
            v = self.squash(s)
            if i < self.num_routing - 1:
                a = tf.reduce_sum(inputs_hat * tf.expand_dims(v, 2), axis=-1, keepdims=True)
                b += a

        return v

    def squash(self, vectors):
        s_squared_norm = tf.reduce_sum(tf.square(vectors), axis=-1, keepdims=True)
        scale = s_squared_norm / (1 + s_squared_norm)
        return scale * vectors / tf.sqrt(s_squared_norm + tf.keras.backend.epsilon())
